## Welcome to the strategy turn based anime game

I had a few names for the project, but I will call it that for now.
I had many inspirations, a mix of XCOM and Pathfinder 2e in gameplay,
some other anime games that i found in darkest corners of the internet,
but I still need to implement everything and I am short on time to
work on this project.
Feel free to fork, or make a contribution if you want.

### "What is this game even about?"

There will be nice characters... and also there I think there will be some
lore that probably no one will even care, it's about crime I guess,
and you can shoot people in a XCOM like gameplay.

## TO DO:
- There is no 3d asset in the game that is not a placeholder, at least adding something would be good.
- Find a way to make the A* pathfinding calculate the shortest route without instantly crashing the game (It is only calculating based on the closest tile).
- Buy the commercial version of the unreal engine genshin shader to use here.
- Finish the Game Develpment Document (GDD)
- Make some concept art of the characters (yes I am an artist, but I don't have time for that)
